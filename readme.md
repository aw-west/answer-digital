## Java
For simplicity, I used [bash](java/bash.bat) commands to run [this](java/script.java) Java program.  It's functionally identical to the python versions.
```
cd %~dp0
javac -cp lib/* script.java
java -cp lib/*; script
pause
```

#### Requirements
javac, java
Firefox


## Python
The [notebook](python/notebook.ipynb) and [script](python/script.py) are functionally identical.  
The notebook is easier to read, but requires the webdriver to be located in the python path.  
So it may be easier to use the script for running.

#### Requirements
Python 3  
Selenium  
Firefox or Chrome  
webDriver
